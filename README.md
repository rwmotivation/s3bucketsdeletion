To delete unused s3 buckets in AWS account

To delete unused S3 buckets in AWS using Python, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). Before proceeding, make sure you have the Boto3 library installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install boto3

Now, you can use the  Python script deleter.py file in repo. to delete unused S3 buckets:

This script defines two functions:

list_unused_buckets(): This function lists all S3 buckets and identifies unused ones.
delete_buckets(bucket_names): This function deletes the specified buckets.
Make sure to understand the implications of running this script, as it will permanently delete S3 buckets and their contents. Always exercise caution when performing such operations.

Note: Ensure that your AWS credentials are properly configured, either through environment variables, AWS CLI configuration, or an IAM role.
